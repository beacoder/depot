// [57] update: replace the content of the element whose id is cart with that HTML
// (1) For simplicity and conciseness, the jQuery library is aliased to $
// (2) $('#cart') tells jQuery to find the HTML element that has an id of cart
// (3) The html() method is called with a first argument as the desired replacement
// (4) helper method escape_javascript() is aliased to j(),
// which converts Ruby string into format acceptable as input to JavaScript
$('#cart').html("<%=j render(@cart) %>");
